## My FYP Subsystem
For this project, I should be familiar with Globally Harmonized System (GHS) labels to build a game platform first. For this part, the main purpose is to enable students to remember the placement and handling of hazardous reagents and medicines. For the second part, I need to complete a platform based on the emergency handling of exposure to dangerous drugs, so that students can handle this situation correctly.
